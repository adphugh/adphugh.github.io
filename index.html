			<h2>About</h2>
			<div class="about-flex">
				<div class="description">
					<p>My name is Adam Hughes. I grew up in the southwest suburbs of Chicago before I graduated high school and moved to Bloomington to attend Indiana University. Throughout my college career, I developed not only an affection towards the problem-solving that comes with developing solutions, but also how people interact and react to their experiences using technology. I quickly realized that the user's experience is just as important as writing functional code, if not more.</p>
					<p>I learned this through the many hats I had in college, including being a technical consultant and later project manager for ServeIT, a non-profit consulting firm devoted to helping local non-profits with any technical needs that they normally could not afford to build. I was a teaching assistant for a 300-level web development course, assisting in teaching students the advanced usage of HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, and responsive design. I was even a tour guide showing prospective freshmen the everyday life of an Indiana University student in the residence halls!</p>
					<p>All of this prepared me for the start of my career in Chicago at Fruition Partners, a DXC Technology Company where I joined as a ServiceNow Technical Consultant. I configured and implemented multiple projects for clients, including implementations of customer service management, IT service management, and asset management. Within my first year with DXC Fruition, I was a techncial lead for two separate client projects. I have also integrated scoped applications from the ServiceNow store for clients as well, proving my versatility and aptitude to clients and coworkers at a young age.</p>
					<p>Outside of work, I enjoy keeping up with web development as a hobbyist whenever I get a clever or crazy idea to run with. I also enjoy playing soccer and ultimate Frisbee with my friends, as well as trying out new restaurants in Chicago!</p>
					<p>If you made it this far, feel free to explore some of my projects below and to contact me via my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adamphughes/" title="Adam's LinkedIn Profile">LinkedIn</a> and/or email with any questions, comments, tips, or collaborative projects you have available!</p>
