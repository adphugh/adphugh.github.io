				<h3>Scope: To deliver a responsive, modern website with a clean navigation and feel.</h3>
				
				<strong>Technical assets used:</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>Bootstrap 4</li>
					<li>HTML5</li>
					<li>CSS3</li>
					<li>Jquery</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p><strong>Background:</strong> My final project for INFO-I360: Web Design was to create a full, responsive website. While most students built portfolios, I decided that I wanted to do something that could make more of an impact. My friend's mom owns a travel agency, so I asked her if I could redesign her website. She agreed, and we had phone meetings a couple times a week to exchange content and ideas. She helped inform me of her wide audience and important features of her website, as well as what she would like to get from her website.</p>

				<p>After conducting usability tests on Aggie's website, I found that the navigation on her site was unclear at times, and that her website is not visually appealing due to its old appearance. I also noticed that her current site is not mobile responsive, which is vital in today's mobile society. A majority of sites are visited most often on phones and tablets rather than desktops or laptops.</p>

					</figure>
				</div>
				
				<p><strong>Result:</strong> Using bootstrap4 and various plugins, I created a reponsive website for Aggie, including content compression and navigation. I decreased navigation options by 37 percent, making navigation simpler for users; this was proven by usability tests after the development site was completed. Finally, I added testimonials to Aggie's site, something that she wanted, but never was able to attain. Using her social media accounts, I found comments made by her clients and added them to her site, with permission of the users.</p>
