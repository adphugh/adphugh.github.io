				<h2>Autonomous Vehicles &mdash; User Experience Design Project</h2>

				<h3>Scope: The year is 2025. Design a user experience for a five-year-old to go to school in an autonomous vehicle with or without the parent in the vehicle.</h3>
				<strong>Assets used:</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>User interviews</li>
					<li>Personas</li>
					<li>Storyboarding</li>
					<li>Sketching</li>
					<li>lofi mockups</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p><strong>Our process: </strong>My team and I began this project by interviewing parents with children around the age of five, which proved to be simultaneously difficult and beneficial. A majority of parents we interviewed said they simply would not let their child ride alone in the car to school, worrying about their safety and overall well-being. We often received responses such as, "What if the car gets into an accident?" or "What if my child gets hungry or thirsty?"</p>
				
				<p>However, we did learn from a few parents that car rides were a great bonding time for them and their children. Parents often utilized this time to interact with their children, asking them about their day, what their plans are, if they learned anything new at school, etc. Armed with this information, my team and I focused our design on both the alone interactions and interactions if parents did decide to travel with their children in the autonomous vehicle.</p>
				
				<strong><em>But why would a parent not let their child ride alone one day and suddenly decide it is okay the next?</em></strong>
				
				<p>Great question! Luckily, the semester before my team and I began this project, I took a course on the sociology of childhood as part of my minor. One thing I learned about was how parents begin to trust their children with independent tasks. Essentially, there are three main ways this trust is earned:</p>
				
				<ol>
					<li>The child does said task with an older sibling or authority figure, thus having a witness to say they were successful.</li>
					<li>The child reaches an age of maturity and demonstrates a level of psychological and emotional balance.</li>
					<li>The child does it without permission and informs their parent afterwards.</li>
				</ol>
				<small><em>Source: (“Are Modern Kids Coddled?”, 2010)</em></small>
				
				<p>That being said, we concluded that parents may be weary at first to let their child ride in an autonomous vehicle alone. However, once the parents begin to trust their child and the safety of the vehicle, they would eventually let the child ride alone. Until then, the parents may ride with the child to make sure they are not endangering themselves or others.</p>
				
				<p><strong>The design: </strong>With all of this and additional information we found through research and interviews, we came up with our design: An interactive game displayed on the window of the vehicle.</p>
