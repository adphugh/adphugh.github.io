				<h3>Scope: Revamp the current website for a Bloomington nonprofit to compete with modern orchestra websites, appeal to a wider audience, and improve the presentation of concerts and events.</h3>
				<strong>Technology assets used:</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>Wordpress</li>
					<li>CSS3</li>
					<li>Git</li>
					<li>JIRA (with agile methodologies)</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p><strong>Background:</strong> The Bloomington Symphony Orchestra is a vibrant, community run and operated music organization in Bloomington. They stand out among other orchestras because they appeal to an energetic atmosphere; feel free to shout, clap, dance, or sing during a show! The Bloomington Symphony Orchestra strives to engage the community, young and elderly, with the highest of muscial talent in Bloomington.</p>
				
				<p>While the Orchestra is vibrant, their old website was not. Built in the early 2000's, the site featured poor navigation, an outdated design, and lacked current program information.</p>
				
				<p><strong>My role:</strong> This project was my first time as a team lead for the ServeIT Clinic. This means that I managed an agile team of five other interns to complete the website over the course of fifteen weeks. Aside from working on the website itself, my weekly managerial tasks included:</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>Creating team meeting agendas and leading said meetings</li>
					<li>Weekly status reports, sent to my supervisor and client</li>
					<li>Setting up sprints on JIRA and tracking story progress</li>
					<li>Attending team lead meetings and relaying information to my team</li>
					<li>Holding office hours to assist interns with any issues regarding their tasks</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p><strong>Result:</strong> My team and I added multiple features to our client's website, including an events calendar for listing and organizing upcoming concerts and programs. We also created content for the Orchestra's various outreach programs, which were not advertised on their old website.</p>
				
				<div class="screenshots">

						<img src="images/BSO/outreach.png" alt="outreach programs on nav bar">
						<figcaption>A new menu option, outreach, with details of each outreach program that the Orchestra offers. This was not previously advertised on their old website, so including this will increase awareness of the Orchestra's community involvement.</figcaption>
					</figure>
				</div>
					
				<p>With these new features, the menu bar is now more concise; the previous "purchase tickets" menu option was removed and added to specific concert pages. This way, users do not need to navigate to two different sections of the website to eventually attend an event. We also added outreach events to the calendar to advertise those better, keep related content together, and populate the calendar more.</p>
