				<h2>Feral Cat Friends</h2>
				<small><em>Created in Spring 2016 by the ServeIT Clinic</em></small>

				<h3>Scope: Build a new website from scratch for a Bloomington nonprofit.</h3>
				<strong>Technology assets used:</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>Wordpress</li>
					<li>CSS</li>
					<li>Git</li>
					<li>JIRA (with agile methodologies)</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p><strong>Background:</strong> Feral Cat Friends is a nonprofit in Bloomington who strives to reduce and ultimately eliminate the feral cat community of Bloomington through trap, neuter, and release (TNR) methods. This will help improve the lives of the cats and reduce the amount of feline deaths in the wild.</p>

				</div>

				<p>Our client came to the clinic because she lost her website once her URL was bought out. Since she runs a nonprofit, she does not have a large IT budget. My team and I took on the project using Wordpress so that she could easily edit her site in the future.</p>
				
				<p><strong>The project and my role:</strong> Since our client did not have a website and she was quite easy-going, she gave us a lot of free reign to be creative with the website. We used her existing logo to create various color schemes after landing on the one currently on her website. Our client had a lot of information, which we turned into beautiful infographics as seen above.</p>
				
				<p>My main role included setting up and displaying our client's donation options on her website. Previously, she had used an external donation system that most users were unfamiliar with (after asking a few friends, my team, and my parents). I met with our client to set up a Paypal account that people can donate to using their own paypal accounts or a credit or debit card.</p>

					</figure>
				</div>
				
				<p>This shift to Paypal resulted in an increase in donations over the next six months to Feral Cat Friends.</p>
