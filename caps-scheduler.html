				<h3>Scope: Design a mobile application to make scheduling an appointment with a CAPS therapist a smoother and easier experience.</h3>
				
				<strong>Technical assets used:</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>Invision</li>
					<li>Adobe Photoshop</li>
					<li>Adobe Illustrator</li>
				</ul>
			
				<p><strong>Background: </strong>Scheduling an appointment with CAPS is a daunting task to begin with, and takes a lot of bravery. Without a mobile scheduler, patients had to call the office or visit in-person to make an appointment. Our team wanted to do something to ease this experience for patients and the CAPS staff.</p>
				
				<p><strong>Research: </strong>Our team started our research by interviewing former and current CAPS patients. Some of our interviewees were friends who were open about visiting CAPS, while others were found through an online post asking for interviewees who are comfortable sharing their opinions. We wanted to know how our potential users felt when they scheduled their first appointment in order to create an empathy map of the pains and gains of the current scheduling process. Some of the questions we asked our interviewees are:</p>
				
<!-- The questions we asked our interviewees -->
				<ul>
					<li>How long have you been/were you a patient at CAPS?</li>
					<li>How did you schedule your first appointment? How long did it take you to do (mentally and physically)?</li>
					<li>What were some of your emotions when scheduling your first appointment?</li>
					<li>Have you seen other therapists outside of CAPS?</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>These questions started conversations that were very beneficial towards the project. From these interviews, we realized how nerve-wrecking and horrifying it can be to make that first call. We also learned that the same scheduling process is required if you want to reschedule an appointment you already made, or if you want to know if anyone has canceled their appointment so that a patient can fill that time slot.</p>

				<p>With our user research in mind, our team began mapping out potential experiences for our users. Using our user stories, we were aware that our most important features would be scheduling and rescheduling an appointment, therapist information, and any useful health emergency information. The last feature is important because we want our users to know that they are not alone in this process: sometimes people need immediate help, and we want someone to be there for them. Then, we each created various sketches based on our map and compared sketches to build the best design for our users.</p>

					</figure>
				</div>
				
				<p><strong>Testing: </strong>Once we had a complete sketch of our design, we briefly met up with some of our original interviewees to get their feedback. Afterwards, we used Adobe Illustrator to create hifi mockups of our design. After each of us built our respective screens, we linked each page together using Invision. This way, we could have a functional prototype for our usability tests, where users can navigate between pages and invest themselves in the whole experience.</p>
				
				<p>We created a list of tasks for our users to complete that were essential to the functionality of the application. We estimated the amount of time each task would take on average and timed each user for how long the task takes them. Since our target audience is Indiana University students (since anyone could feel a need to visit CAPS at any time), we felt comfortable interviewing people who have or have not visited CAPS before. <em>The results were amazing.</em> On average, users finished our tasks about 35% faster than we had estimated. Users who had visited CAPS before were boasting about how much easier this process was than when they first called. We also showed our prototype to the director of CAPS, who gave us very positive feedback on our design.</p>

				<p><strong>Symposium Presentation: </strong>In November 2017, our team presented our project at the annual human-computer interaction design symposium on Indiana University's campus. We brought our prototype and a poster describing our project to be judged by a set of three judges, grading for various award criteria. At the end of the symposium, our team won an award for &quot;Most likely to benefit IU.&quot;</p>
