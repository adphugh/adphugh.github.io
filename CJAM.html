				<h3>Scope: Build a new website for a Bloomington nonprofit to provide a clear brand of service to potential clients.</h3>
				<strong>Technology assets used:</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>WordPress</li>
					<li>CSS3</li>
					<li>Git</li>
					<li>JIRA (for agile methodologies)</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p><strong>Background:</strong> CJAM is a nonprofit in Bloomington who strives to mediate conflicts in the community, whether it be between families, neighbors, or coworkers. They approached the clinic in need of help for promoting their services and increasing donations. Their previous website was outdated and did not have a distinctive brand that gave an impression of who CJAM is and what it is they actually do.</p>
				
				<p><strong>My role:</strong> My main task on this agile team was to create a distinction between volunteer and donation payments on the website. To explain: to volunteer at CJAM, you must pay a training fee so that you can learn how to best mediate different conflicts. The past method of payment was to refer to both payments and regular donations as &lsquo;donations&rsquo;. This caused a vast amount of confusion for people who wanted to pay for a service rather than donating their money. Also, volunteer and services costs vary per service, but users had to input how much they were paying based on the system. This caused more fear and confusion from users, especially if they were unsure if they were correctly paying for the right service.</p>

					</figure>
				</div>
				
				<p>To improve this experience, I created separate forms for each service. The donation form separates different programs to donate to and various amounts one can donate, or donators can input their own amount. I also gave the option of recurring monthly donations or to donate in honor of a loved one. <!--Talk about payment form --> Finally, I added separate buttons for each payment method to the sidebar that appears on each web page, creating more calls to action for users.</p>
