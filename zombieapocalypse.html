				<h2>Zombie Apocalypse UX Project</h2>
				<small><em>Completed in April 2017</em></small>

				<h3>Scope: Design a mobile application for survivors of the zombie apocalypse. There are rumors that there are survival camps in California, but cell tower signals are weak. This app is the survivors' only hopes of getting there in one piece.</h3>
				
				<strong>Technical assets used:</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>Adobe XD</li>
					<li>Storyboarding</li>
					<li>Lofi Mockups</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p><strong>Background:</strong> Zombie Apocalypse was the third project in my Undergraduate Interaction Design Practice (uIDP) course. This course, taken in spring 2017, was a rigourous UX design course taught by my favorite graduate professor at Indiana. This project tested our team's ability to design a mobile application with multiple constraints, including:</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>Vector images only</li>
					<li>Real time location services are limited, as well as instant messaging in most areas</li>
					<li>Battery power on phones should not be abused</li>
				</ul>
				
				<div class="screenshots">
					<figure>
						<img src="images/zombie/affinitymap-sm.jpg" alt="post-it map">
						<figcaption>A board of potential issues one may face while trying to survive during a zombie apocalypse.</figcaption>
					</figure>
				</div>
				
				<p>Embracing these constraints, my team and I affinity grouped our options early in the design phase. Knowing that survival is the goal for every user, we brainstormed ways the application could assist with that, using secondary research such as movies and "apocalypse planners" as resources. From our personas, we have determined that there are two general types of survivors traveling to find safety:</p>
				
				<ol>
					<li>Those who prefer to travel alone and keep their safety as their own responsibility.</li>
					<li>Those who travel in groups, either with their family or as a "strength in numbers" survival technique.</li>
				</ol>
				
				<div class="screenshots">
					<figure>
						<img src="images/zombie/zombie-sketching.JPG" alt="Sketching sessions">
						<figcaption>Our team did extensive sketching sessions, brainstorming using the "crazy eights" technique and then comparing ideas and features.</figcaption>
					</figure>
				</div>
				
				<p>Therefore, we knew that we had to design the application to be beneficial towards two different survival strategies. After various brainstorming and sketching sessions, we concluded that having advanced knowledge of what is coming ahead of you in your travels, as well as who is around you, would be very beneficial to staying alive, especially in unfamiliar areas.</p>
				
				<p><strong>The design: </strong>Our team designed an application to view other users along the way in your travels. When users sign onto the application, they are prompted to import their phone contacts into the application. Once imported, the user can view their contacts and see who has checked into the app. If users have checked in over the last 24 hours, then they appear as alive. Between 24-48 hours, the contact's status appears as unknown. Finally, after 48 hours, they are considered deceased or infected. This way, users can see if their friends and family, people they can trust, are alive or dead. The rationale for the status changes is that users must check in or use the application everyday. Our team figures that if a person becomes infected, they will not have the mental capacity to unlock their phone and check into the app; therefore, inactive users can be considered deceased.</p>

					</figure>
				</div>
				
				<p>This appeals to solo travelers too because users can view users who are listed as public on the map. Just like the feature above, users can see if people are alive near them and attempt to find them and trade tips or resources. They can also see users who are listed as deceased and avoid that area, assuming they were killed by a zombie; it is likely that zombies would keep the phones on them too! If a user does not want to be viewable on the map in fear of violent users, they may also switch their visibility to contacts only or private and not share at all.</p>
